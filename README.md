> I'm going to start a PostgreSQL marathon: each day I'll be posting a new "howto" recipe. Today is the day zero, and the first post is here.

> My goal is to create at least 365 posts üòé

> Why am I doing it?
> 1. Postgres docs are awesome but often lack practical pieces of advice (howtos)
> 2. 20+ years of database experience, from small startups to giants like Chewy, GitLab, Miro - always have a feeling that I need to share
> 3. eventually I aim to have a structured set of howtos, constantly improving it - and make the systems we develop at [Postgres.ai](https://Postgres.ai) / [Database_Lab](https://twitter.com/Database_Lab) better and more helpful.
