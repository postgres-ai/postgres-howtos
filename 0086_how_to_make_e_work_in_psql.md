# How to make "\e" work in psql on a new machine ("editor/nano/vi not found")

Sometimes this happens, when you're attempting to edit a query in psql using the `\e` command:

```
nik=# \e
/usr/bin/sensible-editor: 20: editor: not found
/usr/bin/sensible-editor: 31: nano: not found
/usr/bin/sensible-editor: 20: nano-tiny: not found
/usr/bin/sensible-editor: 20: vi: not found
Couldn't find an editor!
Set the $EDITOR environment variable to your desired editor.
```

Setting the editor is simple (use `nano` or another editor you prefer):

```
\setenv PSQL_EDITOR vim
```

But if you work inside a container, or on a new machine, the desired editor might not yet be installed. You can install
it without leaving `psql`, assuming that there are enough permissions to run installation. For example, inside a 
"standard" Postgres, Debian-based (`sudo` is not needed here):

```
nik=# \! apt update && apt install -y vim
```

ðŸ‘‰ And then `\e` starts working!

To make this setting persistent, add this to `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.zprofile`):

```bash
echo "export PSQL_EDITOR=vim" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```
