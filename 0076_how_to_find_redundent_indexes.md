# How to find redundant indexes

Let's discuss today how to find and clean up redundant indexes.

## What is a redundant index?

Redundant indexes refer to multiple indexes on a table that serve the same purpose or where one index could satisfy the
queries that all others do. Two basic examples:

1. **Duplicate Indexes:** Two or more indexes that have exactly the same columns in the same order are clearly
   redundant.

2. **Overlapping Indexes:** When you have a multi-column index, for example on `(a, b)`, and then another index just on
   `(a)`. For queries that only filter on column `a`, the index on `(a, b)` could suffice, making the index on `(a)`
   potentially unnecessary.

Note that `(a)` is redundant to `(a, b)` but not to `(b, a)`. Accordingly, `(b)` is not redundant to `(a, b)`.

Further, we'll also assume that:

- unique indexes should not be considered in this kind of analysis because they have special purpose;
- indexes on expression follow the same rules â€“ we just consider each expression similarly as columns, and expression
  values should be fully matched;
- in case of partial indexes, the conditions should be fully matched (this rule can be adjusted with certain
  assumptions, but we won't do that);
- we don't consider covering indexes (ðŸŽ¯ **TODO:** include them as well).

## Why to clean up redundant indexes

The same [6 reasons that we discussed for the unused indexes](0075_how_to_find_unused_indexes.md) are applicable here.

## General algorithm of unused indexes cleanup

1. Using the query provided below, identify the sets of redundant indexes. It is enough to analyze only one node in a
   cluster â€“ e.g. the primary. It doesn't matter when stats were reset because this analysis is based only the static
   information (DB structure).

2. For each index that is considered redundant, perform a manual analysis to avoid mistakes. If not fully sure, remove
   such index from consideration.

3. Optionally, consider the "soft-drop" technique as described
   in [Day 53: Index maintenance](0053_index_maintenance.md), before actually dropping an index.

4. After proper analysis and testing, drop one index at a time, closely watching the database performance metrics to
   ensure there are no unwanted plan changes. To drop indexes, use `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY`.

## Query to find redundant indexes

Here is a query from
[postgres-checkup](https://gitlab.com/postgres-ai/postgres-checkup/-/blob/a6c8b6ae0772d5f7afb0a7004a740f6643a31aa2/resources/checks/H004_redundant_indexes.sh),
it produces a result in the form of JSON, including the commands to drop indexes using `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY`.
