# Autovacuum "queue" and progress

We know that in some cases, `autovacuum` settings (especially if they are default) need to be adjusted to keep up 
with the updates. One of the ways to understand that the existing settings are "not enough" is to compare
[autovacuum_max_workers](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/autovacuum_max_workers/) and the number of workers
actually used:

```sql
show autovacuum_max_workers;

select
  state,
  count(*),
  array_agg(left(query, 25) order by xact_start)
from pg_stat_activity
where backend_type = 'autovacuum worker'
group by state;
```

ðŸ‘‰ If most of the time, we see that the number of workers currently acting reaches `autovacuum_max_workers`, this 
is a strong signal that it's time to consider increasing the number of workers (requires a restart) and/or make them 
move faster â€“ via [adjusting quotas](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-autovacuum.html) 
(<code><b>[auto]vacuum_vacuum_cost_limit</b></code>/<code>[auto]vacuum_vacuum_cost_delay</code>).

However, we might have a question: how many tables are currently in the "queue" to be processed by `autovacuum`? The
analysis of this "queue" can give an idea how much work the workers need to do and if the current settings are "enough".
The size of the queue compared to the number workers, potentially, can give a metric similar to "load average" for CPU
load.

Below is the report ([source](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/1889668)) that answers it, by looking at:

- current global `autovacuum` settings,
- per-table individual settings for vacuuming,
- numbers of dead tuples for each table.

It compares all this and builds the list of tables that need vacuuming.

Additionally, it inspects `pg_stat_progress_vacuum` to analyze what's being processed right now.

The report has been derived from [here](https://github.com/avito-tech/dba-utils/blob/master/munin/vacuum_queue).

The further development of this query could include:
_analysis of tables "in need of being auto-analyzed"_.
